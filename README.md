### Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JS technology 

In this project, I only used HTML, TailwindCSS and JS technologies. The reason I use TailwindCSS is that it conforms to the pixel-perfect design approach and feels more free. If you haven't used Tailwind before, I would definitely recommend using it with preitter.
